# OPTRA - The Smart Way to Travel
Dynamic Public Transport Management System

Currently, commuters in Delhi NCR are unable to reach their destinations on time due to insufficient vehicles and inefficient use of resources (based on survey of 50 commuters). This has encouraged us to look for a more efficient system. In this direction, I think an organised dynamic public transport management system will help solve this problem. This system will be based on the needs of the commuters so that they can easily adapt themselves to our system. This system will be most useful and effective for regular commuters. The designing and its key characteristics will be explained later in the file. This system will have two components namely: - Customer Management System and Vendor/Vehicle Management System. 


WHY OPTRA?
USP STATEMENT

•	Maintenance

•	Penalty System (Building Discipline)

•	Technology Integration

•	Cheaper and safer

•	Convenient

•	Implementation in several contexts

•	Reduced mixed traffic


CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

•	Design the Network

•	Order Receipt System

•	Order Routing System

•	Transport Allocation System

•	Actual Order Execution System

•	Payment

•	Customer Complain/Suggestion

The workflow of respective components are as given below.

Customer Management System
1.	Design the Network
a.	Designing a hypothetical road network of National Capital Region. Use population density to calculate footfall and according supply of vehicles.
i.	Study of Population of Destinations of Charmwood (Students and office-goers) – Using population density, we can calculate the places which are most frequently visited by people with this data.
ii.	Based on density of destinations designing of routes (network design) – Now that we know where people will travel and how often, we can design routes accordingly.
iii.	Assessment of quantity of vehicles required – This data will also give us a brief idea about the quantity of vehicles which will be required for the system to work efficiently.

2.	Order Receipt System
a.	People give orders on real-time basis. Routing happens periodically (every 30 minutes).
i.	Mode of receipt of order:- 
1)	Mobile based
2)	Web based 
3)	SMS based
4)	Phone call based 
b.	Order Review System – Communication to customer on expected time of drop and taking their acceptance. Similar system will be followed for immediate order system with an exception that immediate orders will be routed through cab aggregators such as Ola and Uber.

3.	Order Routing System
The system will be agile. Routing will be changed based on demand.
a.	Route Assessment and Allocation System of customer orders – Customers will give orders and then the system will arrange cab and route. 
b.	Allocation of routes to customers (Merging of two orders*) – Once the route is decided, it will be sent to the customer for acceptance. (* : If two or more customers have nearby destinations, then the shortest route can be designed to connect both the destinations) 
c.	Communication of routes to customers - Expected time of pick up and expected time of drop
d.	Customer will also have the facility to see all the routes to his destination running at that particular point of time.

4.	Transport Allocation System 
Once routing is done, 1 hour is maximum allocation time of the system. In total, customer must plan 1 hour 30 minutes in advance. In case of immediate requirement, it will also be met.
NOTE: It will be the responsibility of the customer to reach pick up point of our TMS in time. Based on our study of Charmwood area, every minute there are 2 autorickshaws which can take care of 8 commuters at a time. On an average, our study shows that it takes at most 10 minutes to reach our TMS pick up point. 
a.	Vendor Management System**

5.	Actual Order Execution System
When a customer is on board, the customer has a facility to change the destination and also share its ride details with anyone.

6.	Payment
a.	People can pay with card/cash/Paytm. They can also use pass (subscription system). In case of no show of the customers, there will be a penalty system.

7.	Customer Complaint/Suggestions
a.	For scope of improvement and to bring more efficiency.

** Vendor/Vehicle Management System
1.	Types of vehicles required (bus, van, car)
2.	Creating a legal framework for Vendor Partnership Management System
a.	Terms and conditions of cab delivery – A set of rules the cab driver has to follow regarding safety and maintenance of his vehicle.
b.	Vendor Payment and Receipt System (Monthly Reconciliation System) 
c.	Vendor Penalty System – A charge on the cab driver for violation of rules.
d.	Vendor Customer and Feedback System – A system for feedback on cab drivers.
